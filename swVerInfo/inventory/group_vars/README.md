# Group Variables Directory

This directory contains excluded variables for each group in the inventory file. Files in the `all` directory apply to all devices.

## Custom Group Variables

You can create a customized directory for one or more device groups in the inventory. Be aware that the directory name must match the group name exactly as it appears in the inventory file (in this case, the `myhost.ini` file).
